					The Doraemon manga series was first published in December 1969 in six different magazines. A total of 1,345 stories were created in the original series, 
					which are published by Shogakukan. The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama, Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. Turner Broadcasting 
					System bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an English-language release in the United States,[1] but cancelled it without explanation 
					before broadcasting any episodes. In July 2013 Voyager Japan announced the manga would be released digitally in English via the Amazon Kindle e-book service. 
					It is one of the best-selling manga in the world, having sold over 100 million copies as of 2015.
